## TITLE: CLASSIFICATION

Classification is a type of supervised learning in machine learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances based on past observations. Here, I'll provide a simple example using a popular dataset called the Iris dataset and the scikit-learn library in Python.


# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data  # Features
y = iris.target  # Target variable (class labels)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Train the classifier on the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the performance of the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Display classification report
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=iris.target_names)
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
